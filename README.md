Git Clone
Open the terminal
Use the command "git clone [repository URL]" to download a copy of the repository. 
Press enter 


Running it:
First, let's save your code in a file with a ".cpp" extension, like "myfile.cpp".
Next, open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
Now, it's time to let the computer understand your code. Type "g++ myfile.cpp -o myfile" into the terminal and hit enter.
Great job! Now, you can run the program by typing "./myfile" and pressing enter.
The program will now ask for the input and output file names. Go ahead and enter the names of the files you want to use and press enter.
The program will take care of the rest, reading from the input file and writing to the output file. Once it's done, you'll see a message saying "File conversion complete!"
And that's it! You've successfully run the program. Congrats!
